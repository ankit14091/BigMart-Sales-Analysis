In this project we are trying to figure out multiple analysis with the features like store level analysis and product level analysis which will ultimately identify the market size and sales behavior of the items at Big Mart Inc. 

For that we will use, 
Customer segmentation – based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences, which can be used to optimize store layout and item placement. 
Store Performance Analysis – We will analyze the performance of each store based on various factors such as location, size of the store and so on. This can help the company to identify underperforming stores and initiate a good action plan.

The action plan to the problem solving is as follows:
•	Collecting the Data,
•	Cleaning the Data,
•	Exploratory Data Analysis,
•	Making visualization for abstract view
